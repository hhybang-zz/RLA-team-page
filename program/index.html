              <hr>
              <p>The Refugee Learning Accelerator is a six month program, lasting from October 2017 to April 2018. We are not a typical
				  accelerator: we're more interested in building a community of innovators who can collaborate to build
				  technologies which address some of the Middle East's biggest challenges, rather than launching the
				  next billion dollar company. This is an opportunity to learn alongside some of the most interesting
				  work happening at the MIT Media Lab.</p>

                  <h2>1. Apply (Aug-Sept 2017)</h2>
                      <p style:"color=#000000">You put together a team of two to five computer scientists, engineers, and designers all
					      of whom have an interest in applying their technical skills to the real world problems
					      facing refugee learners. You don’t need a concrete idea at this point: we’re here to help
					      you understand the problem and make connections. We look for teams with a good mix of
					      technical and design experience, commitment to some of the countries most affected by the
					      Syrian refugee crisis, and a strong interest in the potential of digital tools to change
					      the way that education is provided.</p>
							    <h2>2. Ideate (Oct-Nov 2017)</h2>
                      <p>Once your team is admitted to the Accelerator, you take part in a six week online workshop designed to get you
					      up to speed with what’s already happening in the field of digital education for refugees,
					      advance your technical skills and help you begin to think about a project to prototype.
					      Your team completes a series of design challenges which get you thinking about how
					      technology could be used to address the needs of refugee youth. All of the Accelerator
					      activities take place online, but we encourage teams to meet face-to-face. We provide
					      access to mentors with expertise in relevant technical fields, digital education and the
					      refugee situation. This is a part time commitment; we expect you to spend between 15 and
					      20 hours a week on the Accelerator.</p>
							    <h2>3. Prototype (Jan 2018)</h2>
                        <p>Teams that have shown the greatest progress and have the promise to take their ideas further, will be invited
					      to join the Prototype phase. We will bring everyone together for a week long design-
					      thinking workshop in Amman, Jordan. By the end of the workshop you will have a first
					      prototype, which has been developed in consultation with mentors who have real world
					      experience. Your team pitches to a panel of judges, who provide feedback.</p>
							    <h2>4. Incubate (Feb-April 2018)</h2>
	                        <p>The teams with the most promising prototypes receive further support to help them continue working on
					      their project. We structure our support for optimal impact: we help you find NGO partners
					      who can deploy your project, we connect you with technical experts to further its
					      development, we host workshops on relevant topics (entrepreneurship, monitoring &
					      evaluation, etc.) and we provide funding to get prototypes tested in the field. You
					      continue to work on the project and think about where you want to take it next--& we do
					      our best to support that vision.</p>
