	<h2 class="FAQ2">General Questions</h2>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('Learning');" style="color: #000000">Why the focus on learning?</a>
	</h2>
	<p id="Learning" class="QA">Because it’s what we do! The MIT Media Lab Learning Initiative is focused on the future of
		learning; we develop technologies and workshops centered around the four Ps of creative learning: peers, play, passion
		and projects. We’re keenly aware that a “lack of educational opportunities” in the Middle East is one of primary "push"
		factors cited by refugees arriving in Europe. And that as the war in Syria continues, the crisis around education in the
		region is only going to become more acute. </p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('RefugeeLearners');" style="color: #000000">What do you mean by
		"refugee learners?"</a></h2>
	<p id="RefugeeLearners" class="QA">We’re interested in supporting projects which benefit refugee youth,
		aged 15-24, who remain in the Middle East, and want to learn--whether that is in a formal school system or more
		informally. The refugee learner does not necessarily have to be the end user of the project--it could also be parents,
		teachers etc., but all projects should be beneficial to refugee learners in some capacity.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ2"><a class="FAQ2" href="#Application">Application Questions</a></h2>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('Eligible');" style="color: #000000">Who is eligible to participate
		in the Refugee Learning Accelerator?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="Eligible">Details on eligibility are available <a class="class2" href="/apply">here</a>.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('Degree');" style="color: #000000">Do I need to have a degree in Computer Science or Engineering to apply?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="Degree">No. However, this is not a coding academy. We expect you and your team to have relevant coding experience. Ideal participants are the kind of people who are active on Stack Overflow, know their way around GitHub repositories, or have built things at a hackathon or two.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('Individual');" style="color: #000000">Can I apply as an individual?
		</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="Individual">No. We’re looking for people to apply on teams. However, if you don’t already have a team you can
		head over to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/147496302487491" class="class2">Facebook Marketplace</a> to
		find other individuals interested in forming a team.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('Team');" style="color: #000000">Does my team all have to be located
		in one place?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="Team">No. It will probably be easier to work together if at least a portion of your team is co-located, but it
		is not a requirement.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('Refugee');"style="color: #000000">I'm a refugee, can I apply?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="Refugee">Certainly. Refugees are welcomed and encouraged to apply.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('NotRefugee');" style="color: #000000">Do I have to be a refugee to
		participate in the Accelerator?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="NotRefugee">No. We're looking to support a community of innovators from the Middle East with an interest in using
		their tech skills to support refugee learners, but you don't have to be a refugee.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('MiddleEast');" style="color: #000000">I’m a refugee and no longer
		live in the Middle East, can I still apply?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="MiddleEast">Definitely! Refugees from the Middle East are eligible to apply from wherever they are currently
		living. Unfortunately, due to restrictions on our funding, we are unable to work with current residents of Syria.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('Abroad');" style="color: #000000">I’m Lebanese/ Jordanian/ Iraqi/
		Palestinian/ Syrian, but live abroad, can I still apply?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="Abroad">Definitely! However, in the application we will ask about your future plans and commitment to the
		region. We’re looking to support projects that will be based in the Middle East.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('Idea');" style="color: #000000">I already have an idea about using
		technology to support refugee learners, can I still apply?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="Idea">Certainly, but you’ll still have to go through the <a class="class2" href="/program">Ideate stage.</a>
		We want you to be up to speed on what is currently happening in the field of digital education for refugees and connect
		with other teams. The Ideate stage is designed to do just that.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ2"><a class="FAQ2" href="#ProgramQuestions">Program Questions</a></h2>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('TimeCommitment');" style="color: #000000">What is the time
		commitment?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="TimeCommitment">The time commitment will vary by phase. In the Ideate phase we expect you to spend about 15-20
		hours per week on activities related to the Refugee Learning Accelerator. In the Prototype phase teams will spend a week
		together in Amman. Overall, the Accelerator is designed to be a part-time commitment. We do not expect you to quit your
		job or suspend your schooling to work on this.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('ForProfit');" style="color: #000000">Does our idea have to be for-
		profit?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="ForProfit">No, definitely not! We want teams to think about the financial sustainability of their projects,
		but there are many different ways to achieve that, both non-profit and for-profit.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('OfficeSpace');" style="color: #000000">Do you provide office space?
		</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="OfficeSpace">No. We are not able to provide any office space in the Ideate phase. In the Incubate phase, if
		necessary, we will coordinate with partner organizations to find office space wherever the team is located.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('Travel');" style="color: #000000">If my team is accepted into the
		Prototype phase, do we have to cover the cost of travel to Amman?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="Travel">No. The Refugee Learning Accelerator will cover the cost of travel for all successful teams. However,
		it is your responsibility to make sure that you have a valid passport.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('MIT');" style="color: #000000">Will participants travel to MIT in
		Cambridge, Massachusetts?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="MIT">No. Successful participants will be brought together in Beirut or Amman. There will be no travel to the
		U.S.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('Certificate');" style="color: #000000">Upon completion of the
		program, will I receive a certificate?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="Certificate">Yes, you will receive a certificate of completion. However, this is not an accredited MIT
			education program and does not count towards an MIT degree.</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('IntellectualProperty');" style="color: #000000">Does MIT own the
		intellectual property of Refugee Learning Accelerator projects?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="IntellectualProperty">Participants retain all intellectual property in their work, but we require
		contributions during the Ideate phase to be openly licensed (software under an open source initiative <a
			href="https://opensource.org/licenses" class="class2">approved license</a>; content under <a
			href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" class="class2">CC BY</a>).</p>
	<h2 class="FAQ"><a class="FAQ" href="javascript:toggleDiv('Program');" style="color: #000000">What do participants in the
		Refugee Learning Accelerator program receive?</a></h2>
	<p class="QA" id="Program">Information on the structure of the Accelerator is available <a class="class2"
												   href="/program">here</a>.</p>

	<h2>What’s the ultimate aim of the Refugee Learning Accelerator?</h2>
	<p class="QA">This is a pilot phase and--to a certain extent--an experiment. We believe that the Middle East is facing a series of crisis around refugees, youth employment, and education, but that it already has many of the tools necessary to respond to these crises. We’re passionate about supporting young computer scientists and engineers to think critically about the future of learning.</p>
	<h2>How can I get involved in the program?</h2>
		     <p>If you’re a computer scientist, engineer or designer from Syria, Palestine, Iraq, Jordan or Lebanon: </p>
<p style="text-indent: 20px">
1. Put together a team <br>
2. Fill out the form on the Apply page with your contact details<br>
3. We’ll email you when applications open in mid-August </p>
			    <p class="QA">If you don’t fit that criteria, but are still interested in supporting the project, email us at <a href="mailto:refugeelearning@media.mit.edu" class="class2">refugeelearning@media.mit.edu</a></p>
